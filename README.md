# CS456 Red/Blue Team Lab

This repo contains my authorized CS456 red-team and blue-team coursework, organized as an end-to-end security exercise: a penetration test write-up (offense) and an incident response investigation (defense).

For the full details and evidence, see:
- **Red Team:** [`./red-team/`](./red-team/) (pentest report, scans, screenshots)
- **Blue Team:** [`./blue-team/`](./blue-team/) (incident response report, logs, packet capture, environment artifacts)

> Note: The blue-team README is based on an instructor-provided dataset used to simulate attack activity, since my deployed lab environment was not actually attacked by my assigned red team partner.
